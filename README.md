# Time-Teller
## Description
### Main Idea
Time teller is an automatic application for determining the time from an analog clock. The program is given an image of a clock of different shapes and sizes, and should produce the time shown on the clock in hours and minutes. 
The style of the clocks can vary. Some have Arabic numbering whilst others are in Roman. Some have dashes for the numbers whilst others have neither. The application should handle different shapes and views and be successful in telling the time. Such program can be useful in computer vision, games, and robotics applications.
